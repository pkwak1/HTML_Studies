Forms just front-end
No back end for actual submission to database
Format:
<form action="/my-form-submitting-page" method="post"
  action = the URL to send form data to
  method = type of HTTP Request
-->

<!--
input is how form reads in info
input type = something (lots of types on MDN)
inputs and forms can exist without each other
BUT a form tag encapsulates input tags
together they make a form
